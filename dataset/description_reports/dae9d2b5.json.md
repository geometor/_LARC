# Task: dae9d2b5.json

In the input, you should see... a 6x3 grid with a yellow pattern on the left and a green pattern on the right.

The output grid size... is 3x3.

To make the output, you have to... copy and paste the left-side of the input (the yellow side) onto the output grid. Then, draw the green pattern on the output grid on top of the yellow (do not copy and paste because the black will overwrite the yellow). Your output grid should now have green and yellow on a black background. Then, recolor each green and yellow square pink, so your output is only pink and black.
