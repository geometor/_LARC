# Task: ecdecbb3.json

In the input, you should see....A grid with lines of x color and dots of y color.

The output grid size... is the same as the input grid

To make the output, you have to...Copy the input grid. Make perpendicular lines from the dots of y color to touch the closest lines of x color.  The point of touch should be the y color. If the dot of y color is between 2 lines of y color you should make one lines of y color going through the dot of y color and connecting the lines of x colors. Surround each dot of y color (point of touch) on the line of x color with a square of x color. It should be a square of x color with the center of y color on the line of x color. Done.

In the input, you should see... A grid with one or more horizontal or vertical lines of pixels of x color and one or more singleton pixels of y color not connected with the lines.

The output grid size... is the same as the input grid.

To make the output, you have to...  Copy the input grid.  Make a line of color y perpendicular the lines of color x to connect each of the singleton blocks to each of the lines.  Change the color of the line blocks where the new line touches,  surround each block that has been to color y with blocks of color x.  Done.
