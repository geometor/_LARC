# Task: 5c2c9af4.json

In the input, you should see... three dots of one color

The output grid size... copy and paste the input

To make the output, you have to... use the two outer dots to form a square around the dot in the middle, then continue making squares surrounding the last square you created until you can not make any more (do not stop when you can not get an entire square inside the black background, even if you have enough room to make one line and the rest of the square would be outside of the black background then make that line). The amount of black space between each box should be the same width as the first square you created (so if the first box width of 2, make them all a width of 2)
