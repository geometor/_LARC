In the input, you should see...a colored area filled in and one square a different color

The output grid size...same size

To make the output, you have to...extend the single colored square to the edge of the grid heading away from the other color. The other color will fill in around the single color line the same amount of squares it is away from the beginning single color square

In the input, you should see... two green rectangles with a red cell on one side.

The output grid size... stays the same.

To make the output, you have to...  Count the number of green cells it takes to get to the closest edge of each rectangle, let's call them X and Y. Remember these two numbers. Continue the red square making a red line to the edge of the grid. you should have two single red lines. Now take the respective number(X or Y) for the the first rectangle draw  X lines of green cells to the edge of the grid on each side of the red line.  Repeat for the other rectangle. you should be done.

In the input, you should see... green shapes on a black background. On the edge of each shape is a red dot.

The output grid size... stays the same.

To make the output, you have to... look at the dot on the edge of each shape. Counting away from the edge, how many green dots follow the red dot, before you reach the opposite edge? From the red dot, draw a line to the edge of the picture. Then on each side of the red line, draw a green border of the same thickness as the number of green dots you counted before.
