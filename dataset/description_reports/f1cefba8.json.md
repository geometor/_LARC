# Task: f1cefba8.json

In the input, you should see...a square with a inner color and a differently colored border. The border will have areas of protrusions from the inner color.

The output grid size...is the same as the input.

To make the output, you have to...copy the input grid. Then locate the areas of the border with the inner color protruding into the border. If the protrusion happens along the right or left border then replace every grid in that row with the same color as the border color unless it is a black grid, in the case that it is a black grid, replace that grid with the color of the inner square instead. If the protrusion happens along the top or bottom border, then replace every grid in that column with the same color as the border unless it was previously a black grid. In the case it was a black grid, replace it with the color of the inner color.

In the input, you should see...colored blocks with singular outstanding blocks in the frame.

The output grid size...is the same

To make the output, you have to...take the outstanding colored block, move it to outside the frame and continue the single line to edge. fill in frame with color of frame.

In the input, you should see.... pattern of colored squares with a random colored square outside of the square

The output grid size...is the same as the input size

To make the output, you have to...take the color of the random square outside the block and fill in a straight line to the border with that color on both sides. Go back in and color the random square to match the background it's on.

In the input, you should see... a colored shape with a different colored rectangle inside of it. The interior rectangle should have a few extra colored blocks around its edges.

The output grid size... is the same as the input grid.

To make the output, you have to... copy the input grid. wherever there are extra squares around the interior rectangle draw a line up or across the interior rectangle the color of the background. So the extra squares sticking out from the interior rectangle will become the background color as well as all squares above and below or left and right, creating lines across the interior square. Stop when you reach the end of the larger rectangle.Then, where the lines you created reach the end of the rectangle, continue those lines using the color of the interior rectangle. So the black border will now have colored lines up to the edges of the grid which are the color of the interior rectangle, and continue the lines you created which are the same as the color of the larger rectangle.
