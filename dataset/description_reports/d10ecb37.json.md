# Task: d10ecb37.json

In the input, you should see...a multi-colored grid with random patterns.

The output grid size...is reduced to a 2x2 grid.

To make the output, you have to...copy the colors used in the top left corner of four squares of the grid and make them the corresponding colors on the output 2x2 grid. So if the top left has a red square, then a yellow square with a blue square below the red square and a green square below the yellow square, then those would be placed in the corresponding squares on the output grid.
