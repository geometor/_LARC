In the input, you should see... a large grid with one shape with black center

The output grid size... is the same as the input grid size

To make the output, you have to...First, copy the input grid and leave it as it is. Then, count the black color grid inside the shape. Next, find another area in the large grid with the same number of black grid as in the first shape, however, it will only be black grid without the shape and the black grid might also be surrounded by black squares or have additional black squares around it. After you find the black grid, replicate the first shape with the black grid you find as the center. There should be two identical shapes in the output grid.
