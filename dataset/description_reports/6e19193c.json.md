# Task: 6e19193c.json

In the input, you should see...two L-shaped areas consisting of three cubes, all the same color.

The output grid size...remains the same.

To make the output, you have to...fill in a diagonal line starting from the center of L-shape (except for the first cube on the inside of the L) that continues until the edge of the grid, in the same color as the input grid.

In the input, you should see...two L-shapes

The output grid size...is the same size as the input

To make the output, you have to...from the center of the L-shapes color in squares diagonal different from the L-shape point direction and the first square you draw should be black and the others will be the same color as the shape.

In the input, you should see... two L-shaped areas consisting of three cubes of the same color

The output grid size... is the same as the input grid

To make the output, you have to... copy the input grid. Look at the black square that if filled would turn one of the colored shapes into a square. Leave that square black, but move one square diagonal from the black square and change that square to the same color as the shape. Continue to fill move diagonal and fill every square with the same color until you reach the end of the grid. Repeat the same thing for the other colored shape.

In the input, you should see...shapes that are like arrow tips.

The output grid size...stays the same as the input grid.

To make the output, you have to...look at the arrow tip shape and notice the black square that if filled in, would make the shape a solid square. Leave this square black. Find the next diagonal square after this one. Fill it in with the original shape color and continue doing this with the next diagonal square until you reach the edge. Do it with all of the arrow tips. Now they should all look like arrows.
