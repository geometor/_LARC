In the input, you should see... a color box or two in the grid

The output grid size... is the same

To make the output, you have to... put a space in between each color going down. Then do the same on both sides of that line except skip the first box and leave it black. Do the same for the other if there is another color box.

In the input, you should see...either one or two colored squares at the top of the grid. The rest should be all black.

The output grid size...is the same as the input grid.

To make the output, you have to...take each color and think of it as a 3 column checkerboard. For each color included, you need to go down and put that color in the opposite spot of the last row. For example, if the color is in the center on the first row, the second row would have color in column one and three. The next row would go back to color in column 2, and so on.

In the input, you should see...2 color squares the top of the grid and the rest are blank

The output grid size...is as same as the input grid

To make the output, you have to...take it as 3 column for each square and fill as a chess board pattern

In the input, you should see...either one or two colored squares at the top of the grid.

The output grid size...should be similar.

To make the output, you have to...make it look like a checkerboard: use the top square provided, the next row will be staggered color, blank, color; the next row will be one square, and so on and so forth to the end. The second colored square represents a new checkerboard design following the same rules. Use the same colors as the starting colored square provided.
