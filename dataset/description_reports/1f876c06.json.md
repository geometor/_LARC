In the input, you should see...various pairs of colored blocks in a black grid.

The output grid size...is the same as the input grid size.

To make the output, you have to...copy the input grid. Then, form a diagonal line by connecting the two of the same color blocks. The diagonal line between each set of matching color blocks should be the same color as the two blocks you are connecting. Do this for each set of matching blocks.
