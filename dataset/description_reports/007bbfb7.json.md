In the input, you should see...a 3x3 grid with only one color

The output grid size...should be three times larger.9x9

To make the output, you have to...or the output repeat 3x3 in the 9x9 grid. to determine how many times the grid must repeat, add the number of color pixels in the input grid. if there are 5 colored pixels, you must repeat the input pattern five times, mimicking the shape of the original grid. For each pixel in the input, that is nine pixel in the output. So each pixel in the input stand for one 3x3 grid in the output.

The output grid size...should be three times larger. 9x9.

To make the output, you have to...repeat the 3x3 input grid in the 9x9 grid. To determine how many times the grid must repeat, add the number of color pixels in the input grid. For example, if there are 5 colored pixels, you must repeat the input pattern five times. The way should repeat is mimicking the shape of the original grid. For each pixel in the input, that is nine pixels in the output. So each pixel in the input stand for one 3x3 grid in the output.

In the input, you should see...3x3 grid with a colored pattern

The output grid size... output grid size is 9x9

To make the output, you have to...create a black 9x9 grid. Copy the pattern of the input grid onto the output grid. However, the number of copies on the output grid is determined by the number of colored squares on the input grid. So if there are 3 colored squares on the input grid, you have to copy the pattern on the output grid 3 times. And if there are 5 colored squares on the input grid, you have to copy the pattern 5 times. The location of the copied pattern on the output grid also follows the location of each of the colored squares on the input grid.
