In the input, you should see...a random pattern of orange, a blue line, a random pattern of grey.

The output grid size...is 4x3

To make the output, you have to...combine the orange and grey into one pattern that take up a 4x3 space. Fill each black space with green. Fill the old pattern with black. You should only have green spaces.

In the input, you should see...a 3x4 grid of orange and black, followed by a vertical line of four blue squares, and then another 3x4 grid of gray and black squares.

The output grid size...changes to a 3x4 grid (three squares across, four squares down.)

To make the output, you have to...look at the two 3x4 grids in the input grid. Imagine those two grids completely overlapped one another on a 3x4 grid. There would be three colors seen: black, orange, and gray. Any square that is not black, will be changed to black in the output grid. The squares that ARE black in the input grid will be changed to green. If the input grid had: orange, black, black on the orange side and black, black, gray on the gray side, the output grid would have: black, green, black.

In the input, you should see... A random pattern of orange, then one row of blue, and then a random pattern of grey

The output grid size... Change the output grid size to 4x3

To make the output, you have to... Combine the patterns of the orange and grey into one pattern (it doesn't matter if they overlap, just combine them into one pattern) These patterns always take up a space of 4x3! With the combined pattern, fill each empty black space with green, and then fill the rest of the spaces from the old pattern black. There should only be a random green pattern created when done.
