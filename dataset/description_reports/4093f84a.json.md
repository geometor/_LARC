# Task: 4093f84a.json

In the input, you should see...gray rows with some other colored boxes in the grid.

The output grid size...is the same as the input grid.

To make the output, you have to...first copy the gray rows or columns exactly. Now imagine that the non-gray boxes are attracted to the gray rows like magnets. Move the non-gray boxes until they are touching the gray rows. Now, every box should be touching the gray rows. The last step is to change all of the non-gray boxes to be gray. The final result should be only gray boxes, all of them connected by the original gray rows/columns.
