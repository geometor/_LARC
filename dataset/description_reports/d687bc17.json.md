# Task: d687bc17.json

In the input, you should see...a grid that has a chain of the same colored boxes on the outer edges of the grid, and inside the colored edges, there are different colored single boxes.

The output grid size...does not matter; any size

To make the output, you have to...copy and paste the entire box. In the end, almost all of the center boxes will be black. Look at the top of the grid; if there are boxes the same color as those on top, move it up to touch the top and then color black any boxes of same color that are left in the middle. Next, look at the right side of the grid, if there are any boxes the same color as the right side, move it up to touch the right side and then color black any boxes of same color that are left in the middle. Repeat these steps for the bottom and left side of the grid.

In the input, you should see...a grid with different colors on the border of it in and then multicolored boxes within

The output grid size...is the same as the input

To make the output, you have to...copy grid. If any of the boxes on the inside match any of the outline colors move them so they are adjoined to it, without changing the row/column it's in. Do this with every color. If a box on the inside doesn't match with an outside color then just remove it. At the end the middle area should be black and the blocks are adjoined to their respective colors.
