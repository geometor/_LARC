# Task: 8f2ea7aa.json

In the input, you should see...a pattern on a black grid

The output grid size...the same size as the input grid.

To make the output, you have to...Imagine the original pattern is a 3x3 grid. What you need to do is copy the pattern in the 3x3 to the 9x9 grid. So you  have 9 3x3 grid inside of the bigger grid(Top left, top middle, top right, middle left, middle, middle right, bottom left, bottom middle, bottom right). For example if the  input pattern is a l shape you would only copy this to the top middle, middle and bottom middle grid.

In the input, you should see... a colored shape on black

The output grid size...is same as the input

To make the output, you have to... first copy the input field exactly into the output field. Now look at the shape in the input field and imagine it is placed in a 3x3 box. Note that each colored cell represent each of the 3x3 area inside of a 9x9 in the output field (top left, top center, top right, middle left, and so on). For each colored cell, copy and replicate the whole shape in the output region in the particular region.

In the input, you should see...color grid on black background

The output grid size...same as input size

To make the output, you have to...each color grid need to change as 3x3 grid and need to copy same pattern in to each grid
