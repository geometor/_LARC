# Task: 8403a5d5.json

In the input, you should see... one color grid with a black background.

The output grid size... is the same as the input grid size.

To make the output, you have to... First, copy the input grid. Then starting from the colored grid, create a vertical line from the bottom to the top. Next, leave one column to the right of the colored line black, then create another colored vertical line beside it, and then leave another column to its right black color. You will repeat this process until the end of the right side. After finish creating the colored line, find the first black column next to the first colored line and color the topmost grid gray. Then find the second black column and color its bottom most grid gray. You will repeat this process alternately until the black columns have gray grids either at the top or the bottom. Your final result should have a pattern such as: colored line - black column with top gray grid - colored line - black column with bottom gray grid - colored line - black column with top gray grid, and this pattern continue to the end of the right side of the black background.
