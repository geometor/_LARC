# Task: d4f3cd78.json

In the input, you should see...a gray square (outside only) with one square of it still black.

The output grid size...is same

To make the output, you have to...Fill in the square with light blue. Make the single black square that should be gray in the input light blue as well. Then you want to continue with light blue to make a line going to the edge of the grid. So it is like a line is going out of the square to the edge like a stop sign (but in any direction)
