In the input, you should see...red shapes on the black

The output grid size...stays the same

To make the output, you have to...first put a green border around each red shape, the size of the border is equal to half the width of the red shape. Second, fill in the black squares directly below the now red and green shapes with blue--the width of the blue is equal to the width of the red shape.  The blue needs to be alligned to the red so that it is centered extending down to the bottom of the grid, making sure to only color in what is black and not coloring over any green.

In the input, you should see...Red squares on a black grid.

The output grid size...same size as original

To make the output, you have to...Put a green border around each red square. The thickness of the green border should equal one half of the thickness of the red square (if the square is 6 squares across then the green border should be three squares deep around it). Fill the black squares below the red and green squares with a vertical line of blue squares. The blue squares should be in the same vertical row as the red square and should be the same width as the red square. If the blue line should intersect with a green box, then the green box should stay. Don't color over any green.
