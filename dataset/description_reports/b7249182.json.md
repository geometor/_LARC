In the input, you should see... two different colored cubes at opposite ends of the grid.

The output grid size... remains the same.

To make the output, you have to... turn each colored square into a row of five extending from the original square across the grid to the other colored row. From the last square in the row, make a perpendicular column 5 squares tall. Add one more to the first and last of this column to connect the two figures

In the input, you should see... two colored squares on a black grid.

The output grid size... is the same as the input grid.

To make the output, you have to... the squares reach out to one another. They stay the same color and meet at the half point between the two. But they do not go out toward one another in simple lines. They reach out in a line of three squares, then turn to the right and left (or up and down) to form two new lines. They do this for two squares, then turn again so that these four lines meet each other.

In the input, you should see...two cubes of different colors

The output grid size...will not change

To make the output, you have to...make each color in line go toward the center.  Make a black empty space in the center by stop the lines 1 square each before they meet. This should give you 2 black squares in the center. Form a new line on each side with 2 cubes on either side for each color.  Put one more colored cube at the end of these lines to make each color connect. This should make an empty space in the center with a size of 2x3.
