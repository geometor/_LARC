# Task: 7c008303.json

In the input, you should see... a 9x9 grid with a light blue cross dividing the input into 4 sections. One section will be 2x2 with many colors, call this section A. Another section will be 6x6 with only green and black, call this section B.

The output grid size... is 6x6.

To make the output, you have to... resize the output grid to 6x6. Copy and paste all of section B (not including the light blue cross divider) into your output grid. Then, recolor the green part of the upper-left 3x3 of your output grid to match the color of the upper-left square of section A. Repeat this for each "quadrant" of your output, making the color match the color of the corresponding corner of section A.

In the input, you should see...a grid with one light blue row and column. There is a one-colored design in one area and a multi-colored 2x2 grid in another area.

The output grid size...will be 6x6.

To make the output, you have to...fill in the entire grid with black. You then need to use each of the colors from the 2x2 grid to make the same design as the green design shown in the input grid. The colors must be in the same area shown in the 2x2 area. Each area will be a 3x3 grid, so there are a total of 4 3x3 grids. If the upper right square in the input pair is pink, then the design in the upper right 3x3 grid should be pink. Repeat the color blocks for the other 3x3 areas.
