In the input, you should see...5x1 grid with black and colored dots.

The output grid size...he height and width will be the number of colored dots in the input times 5.

To make the output, you have to...copy the pattern of the input grid to the bottom left corner of the output grid. On the next row up, copy the pattern of the input grid, but move it to the right by 1 block. Continue this all the way to the top row.

In the input, you should see...five multi-colored squares in a horizontal row.

The output grid size... the height and width are = to [5 * (the number of colored blocks)], so if there are 3 colored blocks, the grid is 15x15, if there are 2 colored blocks, the grid is 10x10, if there is only one colored block, the grid is 5x5.

To make the output, you have to...copy the input. Starting from the bottom left of the output grid, paste the input. Go back to the bottom left, move up one block and to the right one block, paste the input again. Go back to the bottom left, move up two blocks and right two blocks, paste the input again. Repeat this pattern until the leftmost square of the input grid is in the top right corner of the output grid. It will look like a diagonal pattern.
