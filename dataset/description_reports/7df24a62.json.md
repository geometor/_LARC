In the input, you should see...a 23x23 grid with a black background. There will also be random yellow boxes scattered around. Some of the yellow boxes will be surrounded with blue boxes.

The output grid size...23x23

To make the output, you have to...copy and paste the exact same grid. Find all instances of the pattern that is surrounded in blue. Everywhere on the grid where there is the exact yellow pattern, surround it with blue. So, on all sides of the yellow boxes (in the same pattern) will be blue boxes (exactly as shown in the yellow/blue pattern).
