# Task: 952a094c.json

In the input, you should see...a grid with a square or rectangle composed of monochromatic pixels with a colored pixel at each of the interior corners of the rectangle.

The output grid size... is the same as the input.

To make the output, you have to...  copy the input grid to the output workspace.  Move each of the interior corner colored pixels to the exterior corner opposite of their input position.  Meaning, move the upper left interior pixel such that its corner is touching the lower left corner of the lower left corner pixel of the monochromatic rectangle or square.  You're moving pixel at a 45 degree angle to the exterior opposite corner, do that with each interior corner square to create the correct output grid.

The output grid size... is the same as the input.

To make the output, you have to...take the different colored squares from the inside corners of the square and move them to the opposite outside corner of the square. For example if there is a green square on the inside bottom left corner, move it to the outside top right corner. The rest of the squares will be black.
