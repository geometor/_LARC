# Task: 3befdf3e.json

In the input, you should see...a square of one color filled with another color

The output grid size...stays the same as the input grid

To make the output, you have to...inverse the colors used in the original shape then add adjacent 4x2 shapes to the outer square on all four sides in the color of the new center square if it had a 2x2 center in the input, or a 3x1 shape on all four sides if the center had a 1x1 shape

In the input, you should see... a two color shape made up of one square surrounded by a square of another color

The output grid size... is the same as the input grid

To make the output, you have to... create the same shape, but switch the two colors. Use what is now your inside color and create a border around the outside square. This border will be the same width of the middle section of the same color. If a single block is in the center, then border will be 1x3 on both side and 3x1 on top/bottom. If center of shape is a 2x2 square, then border will be 2x4 on both side and 4x2 on top/bottom. Final shape should look like a plus sign.
