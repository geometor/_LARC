# Task: e21d9049.json

In the input, you should see...a shape that has a horizontal line and a vertical line, almost like a cross or an 'L' shape. The background is black.

The output grid size...is the same as the input size.

To make the output, you have to...copy the entire input into the output grid.You will need to extend each area of the shape - the horizontal line should extend and touch both the left and right edges of the grid. The vertical line should touch both the top and bottom of the grid. It should be a cross shape or similar to a cross shape.Copy only the horizontal colored squares. Paste them to the right and left of the horizontal colored squares, but take care to never effect or impact the original colored squares in any way.If the horizontal line is 3 squares, you will move three squares to the left of the left-most colored square, paste, and repeat. If you can't go 3 squares without touching the edge, then color in the pattern on your own. It should be a repeat pattern.Do the same thing with the vertical line, only do it in a vertical way instead of horizontal.
