# Task: 7fe24cdd.json

In the input, you should see...a small section of the the final output pattern

The output grid size...is 6x6

To make the output, you have to...copy the original 3x3 pattern and replicate it after you rotate it clockwise onto the output.  The top left 3x3 section should be a the same as the input.  Then replicate and rotate to the right of this in the 3x3 section to the left, continue this until you have replicate and rotate 3 times total.

In the input, you should see...a 3x3 pattern

The output grid size...increases to 6x6

To make the output, you have to...copy and paste the input grid into each of the 4 corners, offset by 90 degrees to the right.

In the input, you should see... a pattern on a 3x3 grid

The output grid size... is 6x6

To make the output, you have to... treat the input grid as the top-left corner of the output grid. Fill in the other corners of the output, maintaining radial symmetry. So, rotate the input grid 90 degrees clockwise and put that in the top left. Continue this pattern.

In the input, you should see... a pattern with various colors on a 3x3 grid

The output grid size... the grid size is doubled to 6x6

To make the output, you have to... imagine the 6x6 output grid is split into four squares. Copy the input pattern onto the top left square, rotate 90 degrees to the right for the top right square, rotate again for the bottom right, then again for the bottom left.
