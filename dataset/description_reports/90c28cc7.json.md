# Task: 90c28cc7.json

In the input, you should see...colored pattern in black background

The output grid size...horizontal number of color x vertical number of colors grid size

To make the output, you have to...replace group of same color grids with single same color grid.

---

In the input, you should see...in a black background a rectangle or square created from other colored rectangle or squares.

The output grid size...new grid size should be the least number of squares necessary to create a similar, but not always the same, pattern of the colored rectangle or square.

To make the output, you have to...consider only the colored part of the input. Create a similar square or rectangle, using the least number of squares.

---

In the input, you should see... a large rectangle made up of other, smaller rectangles.

The output grid size... should be significantly smaller than the input. It should be the smallest number of squares needed to replicate the layout of the input, with no black visible. It can be a square or a rectangle.

To make the output, you have to... simplify the input pattern, making the smallest rectangle into a single square and scaling down the others accordingly, until the final result resembles a zoomed-in look-alike of the input with no visible black squares.
