In the input, you should see... Grey lines

The output grid size... remains the same as the input grid size.

To make the output, you have to... Copy the input grid to the output grid. To complete the grid a horizontal filled in line must be created in the black spots. This diagonal line goes from top left to bottom right. In some cases the diagonal line will not be perfect, just use best judgement to get as close to one as possible. The FIRST PART in the top left is dark blue, the SECOND PART in the middle is red, the THIRD PART in the bottom right is green.
