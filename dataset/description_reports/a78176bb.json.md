# Task: a78176bb.json

In the input, you should see... a diagonal line of a single color, with gray squares extending out from one or both sides of it.

The output grid size... is identical to the input grid.

To make the output, you have to... keep the original colored line. Place a square of that same color on the black square that at the point of the gray extension.  Now extend another diagonal line out from that colored square, mimicking the original line. Do this on both sides if there are two gray extensions. You should now have two or three lines, including the original. Now recolor the gray squares black, and you're done!

In the input, you should see...a single color with grey color

The output grid size...same as original color

To make the output, you have to...keep the original diagonal color and fill the grey color with black. copy the same diagonal color on the grey color side by keeping space number of original square size make by grey color.

In the input, you should see... a diagonal line with a single color with gray squares on one side or both sides of the line on a large black background.

The output grid size... is the same as the input grid.

To make the output, you have to...copy the input grid. Then create a diagonal line with the same color as the original diagonal line at the side of the gray squares. The diagonal line has to touch two sides of the large black background. Then, color the gray squares with black color.
