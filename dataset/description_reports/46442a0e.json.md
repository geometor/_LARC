# Task: 46442a0e.json

In the input, you should see... A grid with colored pixels.

The output grid size...  Is twice as large as the input, so a 2x2 becomes 4x4 and a 3x3 becomes 6x6 and so on.

To make the output, you have to...  Create a grid twice the size of the input.  Divide the output grid into 4 quadrants.  Replicate the input grid pixels in the upper right quad.  In the upper left quad, place the input grid that's been rotated clockwise 90 degrees.  In the lower right quad, place the input grid colored pixels that has been rotated 180 degrees.  In the lower left quad place a copy of the input grid that's been rotated 90 degrees COUNTER-CLOCKWISE.  Done.

In the input, you should see...You will see a quadrant with a lot of colored pixels.

The output grid size...is the quadruple of its original size. If the quadrant is composed of 4x4 pixels, then its size will be 8x8. If it is composed of 2x2 pixels, then its size will be 4x4 pixels...

To make the output, you have to...You have to follow the same pattern, but rotate it 180 degrees clockwise, and copy the result throughout the quadrant until you have final it. Every time you copy the result, you have to keep turn it.
