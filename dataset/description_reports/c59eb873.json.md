In the input, you should see...blocks of various colors

The output grid size...will be double the input size, so if, for example, the input is 4x4 the output will be 8x8.

To make the output, you have to...divide each block  into a 2x2 square in the same color as the original block. So, each block from the original input grid will become a 2x2 block of 4 squares of the same color as the original block.
