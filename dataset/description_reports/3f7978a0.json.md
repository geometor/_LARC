# Task: 3f7978a0.json

In the input, you should see... A random pattern of grey and light blue tiles

The output grid size... changes based on the size of the central pattern in the input grid

To make the output, you have to... IDENTIFY the "central" pattern in the input grid. This is includes the two grey columns with light blue tiles at the top, AND EVERYTHING in-between those two columns. Create an output grid size to match the size of the central pattern, and fill it with that pattern. It's like taking a part of the input grid and enlarging it onto the output grid.

In the input, you should see...grey pattern move to the edge

The output grid size...change the grid size in to the corner

To make the output, you have to...move along the same size

In the input, you should see...two gray lines with blue squares on the top and bottom of each.

The output grid size... will only be as big as the gray lines with their blue ends, with all the squares that are in between them. (If you see two gray lines that are 3 squares long, and there is 3 spaces of black space between the two lines, your grid would be 5x5: Make sure to include the blue ends of each gray line in your size calculation.

To make the output, you have to...recreate the position of the black space and any blue squares that are between your gray lines. The four corners of your output will be the blue ends of the gray lines in the input. Make sure that the exact amount of black space between the two lines matches the input, and the placement of any blue squares in the black space also matches the exact location in the input. Your output grid should be no bigger on top/bottom or left/right of the blue squares at the end of each gray line.

In the input, you should see...a black grid with some light blue squares and some gray squares

The output grid size...is the same size as the four light blue squares that form a quadrant shape of either a rectangle or a square

To make the output, you have to...identify the four light blue squares that form a quadrant shape of either a rectangle or a square and then replicate everything inside that shape using the same light blue, gray and black colors.
