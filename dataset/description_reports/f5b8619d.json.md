# Task: f5b8619d.json

In the input, you should see...a grid with black  and colored squares

The output grid size... should be double of the input grid. For example input grid 2x2 would create the output grid 4x4.

To make the output, you have to... pay attention to the pattern. All black columns of input grid would stay all black. Columns with colored squares in other columns would have the same color, but all black squares would turn blue. Repeat the pattern twice: horizontal and vertical.

In the input, you should see... some colored squares

The output grid size... is times two of what ever you start with so if you start with a 2 by 2 then the out put would be a 4 by 4

To make the output, you have to...use the in put grid as 4 sections of the out put so that there is a pattern of the first colored squares, then using light blue make lines up and down from the colored squares to until you reach another colored square or the end of the out put grid
