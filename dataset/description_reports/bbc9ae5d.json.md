# Task: bbc9ae5d.json

In the input, you should see...a single row that has a certain number of colored boxes with black box(es) at the end.

The output grid size...the same width as the input grid and the height is exactly 1/2 of the width of the input grid. For example, if the original grid is 8 boxes wide the new grid will be 8x4 (8 wide and 4 tall).

To make the output, you have to...make the top row the same as the row shown in the input grid. Every row that goes down adds one more colored box. So, if the top row has 4 colored boxes, the next row down has 5 and then the next row has 6...etc. This will look like a staircase when you are done. Keep going until the grid is finished.

In the input, you should see...a row with boxes

The output grid size...the same width as the input, the height is half of that number

To make the output, you have to...The top row is the same as the input.  Add one colored block to the row below that, and two blocks to the row below that, etc etc, until it looks like a staircase
