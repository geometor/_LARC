# Task: 10fcaaa3.json

In the input, you should see... one or more colored squares.

The output grid size... is twice as tall and twice as wide as the input grid.

To make the output, you have to... copy the input grid 4 times so you have the original grid in the upper left, then again next to it, below it and again in the bottom right corner.The output grid should be 4 of the input grid.When that is done, go to every single shape and add a light blue square at each corner. This should happen for every colored square. The only time you do not put a blue square at the corner of a colored square is if there is already another colored square in that space.

In the input, you should see... 1 or 2 squares filled in with the same color on a black background.

The output grid size... is double the height and width of the input grid.

To make the output, you have to... resize the output grid to be double the width and height of the input grid. Then, copy and paste each colored square in the input grid 4 times -- once in each "quadrant" (if, in the input, the square is in the uppermost and leftmost corner, then it should be in the uppermost and leftmost corner in the output, as well as in the uppermost and leftmost corner of each "quadrant"). Then, for every single colored square, do the following: put a light blue square on each adjacent corner, forming a cross with 4 light-blue squares and the colored square in the middle.

In the input, you should see... a few colored squares on a black background

The output grid size... is double the height and width of the input grid

To make the output, you have to... copy the input. Then, resize the output grid to be double the width and height. Then, copy the upper-left quadrant of your output grid (which is the same as the input grid) and paste it once in each quadrant of the output grid. You should have 4x as many colored squares in the output as in the input. Then, for each colored square in the output, do the following: add a light blue square 1 above and to the left, 1 above and to the right, 1 below and to the left, 1 below and to the right. Each light blue square should be diagonally touching the colored square, forming an X with the colored square in the center. Some of the X's might overlap or go off the screen. That is okay.
