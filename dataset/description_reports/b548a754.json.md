In the input, you should see...a shape consisting of two colors. You will also see a single square alone.

The output grid size...the same as the input grid size.

To make the output, you have to...continue the pattern of the big shape, almost as if you were doing a drag and drop. Use the single square as an indicator point of how big the shape needs to be. In other words. the new big shape will cover the single point, and the single point will not be there anymore.
