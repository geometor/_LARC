# Task: c3e719e8.json

In the input, you should see...a 3x3 grid with all colored boxes.

The output grid size...needs to be 9x9.

To make the output, you have to...Notice that you can copy the original 3x3 grid 9 times into the new grid (nine 3x3 patterns) and fill out the new grid in this pattern. Now look at which color is the most common in the input grid and keep that in mind. For example, if blue is the most common color in the input box and the top, left box is blue then copy the entire 3x3 box into the top, left 3x3 area in the new grid. If the bottom, middle box is blue then copy the entire 3x3 grid into the middle top of the new grid. Alternatively, suppose the top right box is red (or any other color that is not the most common) in the input grid...then that top right 3x3 area should be black in the new grid. Keep following that pattern until you're done. The black holes should now correlate to the locations of the colors of the boxes (in the input grid) that were not the most common.

In the input, you should see...3x3 grid with a color pattern that will be repeated in output

The output grid size...enlarged to 9x9

To make the output, you have to...copy the input pattern.  paste in output in a way that's similiar to the most common color in the input.  For instance is green is the most common color and the green boxes are diagonal, this pasted pattern would be diagonal as well
