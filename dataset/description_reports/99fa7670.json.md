The output grid size...extend pattern

To make the output, you have to...add blocks

In the input, you should see... a black background with single 1x1 dots of different colors.

The output grid size... should be the same as the input.

To make the output, you have to... Take each dot and continue it until it touches the right edge to become a line. Then, starting from the colored line at the bottom, continue the line at the right edge down and continue until it touches the bottom edge. Do the same for each line until it touches the next colored line.

In the input, you should see...colored blocks on a black background

The output grid size...same as input

To make the output, you have to...extend the colored blocks, using their original color, to the right and downward, creating "L" shapes. Start with the bottom-most block. Draw a line from the bottom-most block until it touches the right side of the grid, and then draw a line downward from there until it touches the bottom of the grid. This will form an inverted "L" shape that is facing left. Then, go up to the next colored block and repeat this process, except when you draw the line downward, stop where it would touch the first color. This will form another inverted "L" shape, on top of the first one. Do this for each colored block.
