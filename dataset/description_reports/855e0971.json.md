# Task: 855e0971.json

In the input, you should see...several randomly placed black tiles on varying blocks of colors.

The output grid size...is similar.

To make the output, you have to...make one single line of black tiles, using the black tile provided, to cover the color block that it is located in either horizontally or vertically. You figure this out by determining which line would be shorter and create single black line in that manner. That is you have one black line that goes from the top of the color grid that it is in, to the bottom of that color grid. Or from side to side, depending on length.
