In the input, you should see... a blue square

The output grid size... is the same as the input grid

To make the output, you have to... put two light grey squares above the blue square. Then two more light grey squares to the right of the last square you added. Put another two grey squares going up, and continue this pattern until you reach the end of the grid. This will build a grey staircase pattern from the blue square to the upper right corner.Beginning at the blue square again, put two light grey squares going down. Then put two going left, then two down, and continue until you reach the end of the grid. This will build a grey staircase pattern from the blue square to the bottom left corner.

In the input, you should see...one light blue square

The output grid size...is the same as the input

To make the output, you have to...place two gray pixels above the light blue square. Then make three gray squares (total) to the right, then three more (total) going up, etc to the end of the border. Do the same thing going down, except the squares should go to the left instead of to the right. It should look like stairs, sort of.
