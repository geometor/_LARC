# Task: 6cdd2623.json

In the input, you should see...a black background with a bunch of colored squares on it. You should also notice that only one of the colors has 4 squares.

The output grid size...is the same size as the input grid.

To make the output, you have to...draw two lines connecting both pairs of colored squares, all the way across the grid, same color as the squares (for instance, if you noticed that you have 4 green squares on the input, on the output connect the ones on top and bottom edge of the grid with a green line, and the ones on left and right edge of the grid with a green line). If both sets of squares are on the top/bottom or left/right, connect the lines across the grid, not along the edge (in other words, do not connect the two left squares or two top squares. Always connect the line to the opposite square). All other squares on your grid that are not your lines should be black.

In the input, you should see...a grid of colored squares where four on the edge are the only four squares of a single color

The output grid size...is the same as the input

To make the output, you have to...you have to...only join the four squares on the edge to the square on the other side. The rest of the grid is black.

In the input, you should see...a black grid with three different color squares on some sections of the grid.

The output grid size...is the same size as the input grid

To make the output, you have to...identify the four squares, all the same color, that are mirror image of each other on the grid and then fill in either a horizontal and vertical line, or two horizontal lines or two vertical lines of the same color.
