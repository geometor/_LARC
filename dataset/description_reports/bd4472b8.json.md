# Task: bd4472b8.json

In the input, you should see...a 4x10 grid. The first row of the grid shows 4 squares of different colors. The second row shows 4 gray squares. The rest of the grid should be black.

The output grid size...should be the same

To make the output, you have to...fill the black grid starting from the third row using the colors of the squares in the first row. For example, first fill the four squares of the third row with the color of the first square of the first row then fill the four squares of the fourth row with the color of the second square of the first row. Fill the whole grid to the end following this sequence.

In the input, you should see...a line of colored squares, with a gray line underneath it, with black lines underneath those, all the way to the bottom.

The output grid size...is the same size as the input grid.

To make the output, you have to...copy over the input exactly as it is to the output (line of colored squares, gray line beneath it, and the black lines below those). Now, replace the black lines with lines made of the colors from your top row, and alternate them (for instance, if your colors on the top row are red, blue, yellow, then you would replace the black lines with a red line, then a blue line, then a yellow line, then a red line, then a blue line, then a yellow line). Make sure that your top line and gray line still match the input.
