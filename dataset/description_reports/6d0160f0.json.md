# Task: 6d0160f0.json

In the input, you should see...9 squares created by lines of grey

The output grid size...is the same as the input grid size

To make the output, you have to...take the 3x3 area with a yellow square and move it into a 3x3 area corresponding to where the yellow square is within the 9 squares. Then make all other squares within the other 9 squares black and any grey squares within the 9 squares black. The lines of grey stay.

In the input, you should see...9 squares, each measuring 3x3 which are created by grey lines that form a hashtag

The output grid size...is the same as the input grid size

To make the output, you have to...find the only 3x3 grid in the input that contains a yellow square. Make each of the 9 3x3 grids all black, then copy and paste the grid with the yellow square into the 3x3 grid that corresponds to the 3x3 grid square that the yellow square is in. So if the yellow square is in the middle square in the grid, copy that entire grid into the middle 3x3 grid. Finally, change any grey squares inside the grid to black.
