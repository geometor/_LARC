# Task: 5daaa586.json

In the input, you should see...four colored lines that form either a square or rectangular shape in the middle of the black background with colored squares in it.

The output grid size...is the same as the size of the square or rectangle shape in the middle of the black background that is formed by the four colored lines.

To make the output, you have to...change the grid size to just the square or rectangle formed by the four colored lines. Then look at the random dots in the middle of the square or rectangle. Find the colored border that matches the color of the dots, using that color, you will connect each dot to that border in a straight line. You should have 3 to four straight lines touching the matching border.
