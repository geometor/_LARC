In the input, you should see... tall grid that made up of red and black blocks is split into a top half and bottom half  by a line of yellow blocks

The output grid size...he grid size of the output grid is only as large as the top half of the input grid, above and not including the yellow blocks

To make the output, you have to... the grid up so that it is on top of the top half. If two red blocks are on top of each other they turn black. If a red block is on top of or below a black block it becomes green. If two black blocks are on top of each other they stay black.
