In the input, you should see... a structure on the bottom of the grid made up of two different colors.

The output grid size...is the same as the input grid size.

To make the output, you have to...copy the input. Then, notice the color that is on the inside part of the structure. Using this color, after identifying the top layer of the structure, make diagonal lines starting at the left and right top layer all the way to the sides.

In the input, you should see... a structure of different colors along the bottom of the grid.

The output grid size... is the same as the input grid size.

To make the output, you have to... create a diagonal line from the top of the structure to the edge of the grid in the same color as the interior color of the original structure.
