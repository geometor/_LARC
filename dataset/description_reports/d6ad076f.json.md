# Task: d6ad076f.json

In the input, you should see....two rectangle that are different colors

The output grid size... stays the same to make the output you have to copy the grid you need to connect each rectangle with a light blue straight line

To make the output, you have to...connect the shapes with a light blue block

---

In the input, you should see...2 shapes of the different colors

The output grid size...is the same size as the input grid

To make the output, you have to...color a light blue bridge between the two shapes. Do not connect the bridge between from the outside 2 squares of the smaller shape.

---

In the input, you should see...see two sets of blocks in different colors.

The output grid size...should remain the same.

To make the output, you have to...connect the two sets of blocks using light blue blocks leave the connection one width smaller than the smaller set of blocks.

In the input, you should see... two rectangles that are different colors. One should be smaller than the other.

The output grid size...stays the same.

To make the output, you have to... Copy the grid. You need to connect each rectangle with a light blue straight line. The thickness of the line depends on the smaller rectangle. the light blue line should be 1 row/column less on each side than the smaller rectangle. you  are done.

---

In the input, you should see...2 shapes on a black background

The output grid size...same as input

To make the output, you have to...connect the shapes with a light blue block. The new connecting block is smaller than the smaller of the input blocks. Remove 1 rows of light blue squares from each side that is 90 degrees from the input squares.

---

In the input, you should see... two different color shapes with some space between them.

The output grid size...same as the input grid.

To make the output, you have to...copy the input grid and connect the two shapes with the blue grid.it must be smaller than the size of the small input shape.
