# Task: 6855a6e4.json

In the input, you should see...correctly choosed

The output grid size...totally

To make the output, you have to...output grid perfectly

---

In the input, you should see...two parallel red brackets with a gray shape outside of each bracket. The gray shapes are both different in nature.

The output grid size...remains the same as the input grid size

To make the output, you have to...leave the red brackets as they are. The gray shapes will move from outside the brackets to in between the brackets. Imagine pulling the gray shape by the edge closest to the bracket and placing that edge four columns over inside the brackets. Then, flip the gray object over like you would flip over a playing card. What you have may result in the two gray shapes now touching, or they may have space between them. There should be one column of black between the red bracket and its correlating gray shape.

---

In the input, you should see...two lengths of the same colored pixels that form brackets. You will also see two shapes outside of the brackets.

The output grid size...should be the same size as the input grid.

To make the output, you have to...copy the input grid. the two shapes must move to inside the brackets. They must be inside the brackets so that there is a black line of pixels between the shapes and the brackets. The shapes must also be flipped vertically.
