# Task: 469497ad.json

In the input, you should see...a 5x5 grid with a 2x2 grid square surrounded that is surrounded by black and the bottom and right edges filled with colored squares.

The output grid size...the height and width is 5 multiplied by the number of unique colors (except black).

To make the output, you have to...fill in the grids with each colors so that it looks exactly like the input even though the out put will have a larger grid size. Then look at the colored square that is surrounded by black, and extend a diagonal red line from its corner all the way until it reaches the grid boundary or the colored border.

In the input, you should see...a 5x5 grid with a row of colored blocks on the bottom and on the right. There is also a group of 4 same-colored blocks separate from the colored edges.

The output grid size...is determined by the number of colors on the grid (black is not counted) multiplied by 5. For example, a grid with 4 colors would result in a 20x20 output grid.

To make the output, you have to...recreate the input pattern in the larger output grid. For the border, the number of colors on the grid determines how many rows. So, a grid with 4 colors would have 4 rows on the bottom and 4 on the right, For the separate colored block multiply the number of colors by 2 in order to determine its size. So, a grid with 4 colors would mean the block would be 8x8. Finally, make a row of red squares extending from each corner of the separate block and ending at either the colored border or the edge of the grid.

In the input, you should see...a 5x5 grid with a 2x2 square of one color and the left and bottom edges filled with squares of various colors.

The output grid size... is determined by the number of colors in the input grid. The output grid should be the dimensions of the input grid multiplied by the number of colors.

To make the output, you have to...taking the same input grid and blowing it up by the same factor you increased the grid size by. The square and the colored borders should increase in size or thickness by the same factor as you increased the grid. Finally you should go to each corner of the square and add a diagonal line of red squares that will radiate out from the corners until they reach a corner or one of the colored borders.

In the input, you should see... a 5x5 grid with a 2x2 square and a border made up of some number of other colors.

The output grid size... is different depending on the number of colors in the right and bottom border of the input. If there is one color, the output is 10x10, if there are two colors the output is 15x15 and if there are 3 colors the output is 20x20.

To make the output, you have to... recreate the input but make it take up the whole, larger grid. So if the grid is now 10x10 and the input is 5x5, the 2x2 colored square should now be 4x4. If the grid is now 15x15, the square should be 6x6. If the grid is now 20x20 the square should be 8x8. The same is true of the border; if the border on the bottom and right is 1 color, it should become 2 squares thick in the output grid. If it is 2 colors it should become 3 squares thick and if it is 3 colors it should become 4 squares thick. If you took away the grid lines, the output would look just like the input except for the following extra change.As the final step, draw red diagonal lines coming out from each corner of the colored square until they reach the colored border or the edge of the grid.

In the input, you should see... a colored square with colorful borders on the right and bottom side of the black 5x5 grid background.

The output grid size...the numbers of colors on the black background multiplied by 5

To make the output, you have to... create the output grid, first identify how many colors there are on the black background, and multiply the number of colors by 5. So if you have 3 different colors, your grid will be 15x15 and if you have 2 different colors, your grid will be 10x10, and so on. Then multiply the colored square and the border by the number of colors and copy it onto the output grid so it will look like the input grid but in larger size.Finally, draw diagonal red lines out from each corner of the colored square to the edge of the black background.
