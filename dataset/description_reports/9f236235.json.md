# Task: 9f236235.json

In the input, you should see...a single-colored grid of symmetrical lines that intersect to create segmented boxes. The boxes are filled  and create a design.

The output grid size...becomes smaller. Equal to the number of segmented boxes present in the input grid

To make the output, you have to...avoid the lines that create the boxes, and instead  focus on the pattern. Copy the pattern so that it is mirrored horizontally (left to right). You should end up with only the design from the input.
