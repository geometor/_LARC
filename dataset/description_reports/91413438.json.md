# Task: 91413438.json

In the input, you should see...a colored grid pattern on 3by3 black background grid.

The output grid size...count the colored grid in the design pattern. If it is 3 the size of the output grid will 18by18. If it is 4 the size of the output grid will be 15by15. And if it is 5 the output grid size will be 12by12 while 6 will have 9by9 output grid size.

To make the output, you have to...to make the output repeat the design horizontally from the top of the grid by the number of the colored grid on the background using the unique background explained above.

In the input, you should see...a colored pattern on 3x3 black grids

The output grid size... change depending on the numbers of the colored grids in the input grid. The change is as follow: 3 colored grids (input pattern) =  18x18 output grid; 4 colored grids (input pattern) = 15x15 output grid; 5 colored grids (input pattern) = 12x12 output grid; 6 colored grids (input pattern) = 9x9 output grid.

To make the output, you have to... First, count the numbers of the colored grids in the input grid, then create the output grid based on the output grid size instruction. Then, keeping in mind the number of the colored grids, copy the exact pattern from the input grid to the output grid, with the same number of times as the number of the colored grids starting from the left side to the right. For example,  if the pattern on the input grid has 3 colored grids, you will copy the exact pattern to the output grid 3 times, starting from the left to the right; if the pattern on the input grid has 5 colored grids, you will copy the exact pattern to the output grid 5 times, starting from the left to the right.

In the input, you should see...a pattern with a amount of space colored in (from 1 to 9.)

The output grid size...becomes different with the different amount of colored in space, more information in the next step.

To make the output, you have to...you have to figure out how many colored in space you have and the grid becomes different because of that. 3 = 18x18 grid, 4 = 15x15 grid, 5 = 12x12 grid, 4 = 9x9 grid, and so on. Then you make the first image and copy it across from left to right until you have it the same number of times as colored space. So if you have 5, you would copy it 5 times.
