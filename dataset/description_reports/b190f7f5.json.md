# Task: b190f7f5.json

In the input, you should see...some squares of various colors on one half of the grid and some blue square that make a pattern on the opposite side of the grid.

The output grid size...will be the size of grid with the light blue squares multiplied by the length of the grid with the light blue squares. So, for example, if the light blue squares are in a 4x4 grid, the output grid will be 16x16.

To make the output, you have to...replace each of the colored squares on the input grid with the light blue pattern but in the color of the square, then orient the pattern to correspond with the colored squares in the new grid.
