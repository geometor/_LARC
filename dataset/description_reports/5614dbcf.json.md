# Task: 5614dbcf.json

In the input, you should see...a series of colored squares with random gray little squares included.

The output grid size...is reduced to 3x3 grid.

To make the output, you have to...changed the colored squares in the input grid to a single square of the grid. So that an input grid 3x3 colored square is turned into a single filled square of the same color on the input grid. the same color

In the input, you should see...a grid of large colored squares with random gray single squares.

The output grid size...reduced to a 3x3 grid.

To make the output, you have to...see the pattern of large colored squares made with smaller squares. Ignore the single gray squares. Each large colored square made of many small squares should be a single square on the output grid.
