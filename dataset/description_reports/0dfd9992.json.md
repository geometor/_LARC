In the input, you should see....A repeating tile pattern

The output grid size...is the same as the input grid

To make the output, you have to...copy input grid exactly.  Fill in all black boxes to draw establish pattern

In the input, you should see...a mostly filled in grid with a few black holes.

The output grid size...is the same as the input grid.

To make the output, you have to...start by copying the input grid exactly. Fill in all of the black boxes to complete the pattern until there are no more black boxes. To do this notice the pattern of the colored boxes. For example the top row might repeat every 4th row (or 5 rows or whatever the number of rows is before it repeats).  Once you've figured out the pattern just fill in the black boxes with the correct colored boxes. In the end you should see repeating patterns of colored boxes and there should be no black boxes in the grid.
