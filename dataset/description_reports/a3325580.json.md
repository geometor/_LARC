In the input, you should see... colored shapes against a black background

The output grid size... will be the size that the output lines require.

To make the output, you have to... identify the largest shapes by number of squares. This may be one shape or more than one shape, if they have the same number of square. Then create a vertical line for each of those shapes, in the order from left to right of the shapes, each line with the same number of squares as the input shape. If only one shape is largest, there will be one output line. If two shapes are largest together, there will be two lines, and so on.
