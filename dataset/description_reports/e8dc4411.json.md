In the input, you should see...a black pattern with another colored single grid beside it, different from the colored grids of the background.

The output grid size...is the same as the input.

To make the output, you have to...without any change in the colors of any patterns, shapes, size and the background, copy the pattern on the black colored grids, to the other grid which is not patterned thus replicating it with the pattern and size of the black grid, continue to add the same pattern diagonally towards the only edge of the grid.

In the input, you should see...the pattern in black and one another color cell on the diagonal direction

The output grid size...the same size

To make the output, you have to...start from the none black color cell, and replicate the black cells pattern in the diagonal direction, the replicate pattern fully touch the border as end.

---

In the input, you should see...a black pattern on a colored grid with one colored block next to it.

The output grid size...is the same.

To make the output, you have to...copy the black pattern, in whatever the color of the space is next to it, diagonally all the way to the edge of the grid. All other colors stay the same.

In the input, you should see...a black pattern on a colored grid with one colored block next to it.

The output grid size...is the same size.

To make the output, you have to...repeat the original pattern diagonally (in the same direction as the colored block) all the way to the edge of the grid starting from the colored block.  The new pattern must be the same color as the colored block and may be cut off by the edge of the grid (if not that's fine too).

---

In the input, you should see... a black shape with one colored square diagonal in one direction

The output grid size... is the same as the input grid

To make the output, you have to... using the color of the single colored square, copy the shape of the black shape and build it so that it is diagonal from the black shape. Continue the same pattern in the same color until you reach the end of the grid.
