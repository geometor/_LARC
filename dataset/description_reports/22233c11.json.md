In the input, you should see... Set(s) of diagonal green tiles

The output grid size... remains the same size as the input grid.

To make the output, you have to... Put a light blue tile diagonal of each side of the green tiles that skips one black tile. Imagine an X is trying to be created, EXCEPT the light blue tiles skip the first diagonal tile (leave black) to make one light blue tile on each side.

In the input, you should see...diagonal green line(s)

The output grid size...remains the same as the input grid

To make the output, you have to...replicate the diagonal green line(s). At a perpendicular position of the green line(s), skip the number of squares which make the width of the green line, and place light blue squares equal in size to the width of the green line(s) on both sides of the green line(s).
