# Task: b775ac94.json

In the input, you should see...colored squares positioned into patterns. One "fully formed" pattern will have a uniform color. Differently colored blocks will butt against this first pattern

The output grid size...stays the same as the input

To make the output, you have to...expand the oddly colored cells into a pattern that mimics and mirrors the original set of cells that form the "fully formed" pattern. The output will have a snowflake appearance or a half or three-quarters of this "snowflake". In other words, 4 different colors bunched together will form a fully symmetrical "snowflake", while 3 will produce a "three-quarters" one. If that makes any sense.

---

In the input, you should see...small clusters of different colored squares and a design nearby that uses only one of those colors.

The output grid size...is the same as the original.

To make the output, you have to...form the same pattern off of the other colored squares, positioned like a mirror image of the original.
