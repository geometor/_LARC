In the input, you should see...a green cube consisting of four green squares in the middle, surrounded by either one, two, three, or four red square designs on a black tile background.

The output grid size...is similar.

To make the output, you have to...use the same red design to create a symmetrical design surrounding the green cube. The red design should hit all four corners, the same as the first (second or third) design. If there are already four designs present, then simply copy the entire grid and do not change anything.
